             <div  class="center"id="tribute-info">
                 
                     <p>Maathai was born on 1 April 1940 in the village of Ihithe, 
                         Nyeri District, in the central highlands of the colony of Kenya. Her family was Kikuyu,
                          the most populous ethnic group in Kenya, and had lived in the area for several generations. 
                          Around 1943, Maathai's family relocated to a White-owned farm in the Rift Valley, near the town of Nakuru,
                           where her father had found work. Late in 1947, she returned to Ihithe with her mother, as two of her brothers were 
                           attending primary school in the village, and there was no schooling available on the farm where her father worked.
                            Her father remained at the farm.Shortly afterward, at the age of eight, she joined her brothers at Ihithe Primary School.</p>
                     <p>At the age of 11, Maathai moved to St. Cecilia's Intermediate Primary School, a boarding school at the Mathari Catholic Mission in Nyeri.
                          Maathai studied at St. Cecilia's for four years. During this time, she became fluent in English and converted to Catholicism.
                           She was involved with the Legion of Mary, whose members attempted "to serve God by serving fellow human beings." Studying at St. Cecilia's,
                            she was sheltered from the ongoing Mau Mau uprising, which forced her mother to move from their homestead to an emergency village in Ihithe.
                             When she completed her studies there in 1956, she was rated first in her class, and was granted admission to the only Catholic high school
                              for girls in Kenya, Loreto High School in Limuru.</p>
                     <p>As the end of East African colonialism approached, Kenyan politicians, such as Tom Mboya, 
                         were proposing ways to make education in Western nations available to promising students. 
                         John F. Kennedy, then a United States Senator, agreed to fund such a program through the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation, 
                         initiating what became known as the Kennedy Airlift or Airlift Africa. Maathai became one of some 300 Kenyans selected to study in 
                         the United States in September 1960.</p>
                     <p>She received a scholarship to study at Mount St. Scholastica College (now Benedictine College), in Atchison, Kansas,
                          where she majored in biology, with minors in chemistry and German. After receiving her bachelor of science degree in 1964,
                           she studied at the University of Pittsburgh for a master's degree in biology. Her graduate studies there were funded by the Africa-America Institute
                           , and during her time in Pittsburgh, she first experienced environmental restoration, when local environmentalists pushed to rid the city
                            of air pollution. In January 1966, Maathai received her MSc in biological sciences,[18] and was appointed to a position as research assistant
                             to a professor of zoology at University College of Nairobi.</p>
                     <p>Upon returning to Kenya, Maathai dropped her forename, preferring to be known by her birth name, Wangarĩ Muta.
                          When she arrived at the university to start her new job, she was informed that it had been given to someone else.
                           Maathai believed this was because of gender and tribal bias. After a two-month job search, Professor Reinhold Hofmann, 
                           from the University of Giessen in Germany, offered her a job as a research assistant in the microanatomy section of the newly
                            established Department of Veterinary Anatomy in the School of Veterinary Medicine at University College of Nairobi. In April 1966,
                             she met Mwangi Mathai, another Kenyan who had studied in America, who would later become her husband. She also rented a small shop in the city,
                              and established a general store, at which her sisters worked. In 1967, at the urging of Professor Hofmann, 
                              she travelled to the University of Giessen in Germany in pursuit of a doctorate. She studied both at Giessen and the University of Munich.</p>
                     <p>In the spring of 1969, she returned to Nairobi to continue studies at the University College of Nairobi as an assistant lecturer. 
                         In May, she and Mwangi Mathai married. Later that year, she became pregnant with her first child, and her husband campaigned for a
                          seat in Parliament, narrowly losing. During the course of the election, Tom Mboya, who had been instrumental in founding the program
                           which sent her overseas, was assassinated. This led to President Kenyatta effectually ending multi-party democracy in Kenya. Shortly
                            after, her first son, Waweru, was born. In 1971, she became the first Eastern African woman to receive a PhD, her doctorate in veterinary
                             anatomy, from the University College of Nairobi, which became the University of Nairobi the following year. She completed her dissertation 
                             on the development and differentiation of gonads in bovines. Her daughter, Wanjira, was born in December 1971.</p>
                     <p>Maathai continued to teach at Nairobi, becoming a senior lecturer in anatomy in 1975, chair of the Department of Veterinary Anatomy in 
                         1976 and associate professor in 1977. She was the first woman in Nairobi appointed to any of these positions. During this time, she campaigned
                          for equal benefits for the women working on the staff of the university, going so far as trying to turn the academic staff association of the
                           university into a union, in order to negotiate for benefits. The courts denied this bid, but many of her demands for equal benefits were later met.
                            In addition to her work at the University of Nairobi, Maathai became involved in a number of civic organizations in the early 1970s. 
                            She was a member of the Nairobi branch of the Kenya Red Cross Society, becoming its director in 1973. She was a member of the Kenya Association 
                            of University Women. Following the establishment of the Environment Liaison Centre in 1974, Maathai was asked to be a member of the local board,
                             eventually becoming board chair. The Environment Liaison Centre worked to promote the participation of non-governmental organizations in the work
                              of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), whose headquarters was established in Nairobi following the United Nations Conference on the
                               Human Environment held in Stockholm in 1972. Maathai also joined the National Council of Women of Kenya (NCWK).
                                Through her work at these various volunteer associations, it became evident to Maathai that the root of most of Kenya's 
                                problems was environmental degradation.</p>
                     <p>In 1974, Maathai's family expanded to include her third child, son Muta. Her husband campaigned again for a seat in Parliament,
                          hoping to represent the Lang'ata constituency, and won. During his campaign, he had promised to find jobs to limit the rising unemployment
                           in Kenya. These promises led Maathai to connect her ideas of environmental restoration to providing jobs for the unemployed and led to the 
                           founding of Envirocare Ltd., a business that involved the planting of trees to conserve the environment, involving ordinary people in the process. 
                           This led to the planting of her first tree nursery, collocated with a government tree nursery in Karura Forest. Envirocare ran into multiple problems, 
                           primarily dealing with funding.
                            The project failed. However, through conversations concerning Envirocare and her work at the Environment Liaison Centre, UNEP made it possible to send Maathai to the first UN 
                            conference on human settlements, known as Habitat I, in June 1976.</p>
                     <p>In 1979, shortly after the divorce, Maathai ran for the position of chairperson of the National Council of Women of Kenya (NCWK), an umbrella
                          organization consisting of many women's organizations in the country. The newly elected President of Kenya, Daniel arap Moi, tried to limit the
                           amount of influence those of the Kikuyu ethnicity held in the country, including in volunteer civic organizations such as the NCWK. She lost
                            this election by three votes, but was overwhelmingly chosen to be the vice-chairman of the organization. The following year, Maathai again ran
                             for chairman of the NCWK. Again she was opposed, she believes, by the government. When it became apparent that Maathai was going to win the 
                             election, Maendeleo Ya Wanawake, a member organization which represented a majority of Kenya's rural women and whose leader was close to Arap 
                             Moi, withdrew from the NCWK. Maathai was then elected chairman of the NCWK unopposed. However, Maendeleo Ya Wanawake came to receive a majority
                              of the financial support for women's programs in the country, and NCWK was left virtually bankrupt. Future funding was much more difficult to come by, 
                              but the NCWK survived by increasing its focus on the environment and making its presence and work known. Maathai continued to be reelected to serve as 
                              chairman of the organization every year until she retired from the position in 1987.</p>
                     <p>During the first multi-party election of Kenya, in 1992, Maathai strove to unite the opposition and for fair elections in Kenya. 
                         The Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD) had fractured into FORD-Kenya (led by Oginga Odinga) and FORD-Asili (led by Kenneth Matiba); former vice
                          president Mwai Kibaki had left the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) party, and formed the Democratic Party. Maathai and many others believed such
                           a fractured opposition would lead to KANU's retaining control of the country, so they formed the Middle Ground Group in an effort to unite the opposition.
                            Maathai was chosen to serve as its chairperson. Also during the election, Maathai and like-minded opposition members formed the Movement for Free and Fair
                             Elections. Despite their efforts, the opposition did not unite, and the ruling KANU party used intimidation and state-held media to win the election,
                              retaining control of parliament.</p>
                     <p>Wangarĩ Maathai was awarded the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize for her "contribution to sustainable development, democracy and peace." Maathai was the first African 
                         woman to win the prestigious award. According to Nobel's will, the Peace Prize shall be awarded to the person who in the preceding year "shall have done the
                          most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses".
                           Between 1901 and 2018, only 52 Nobel Prize awards were given to women, while 852 Nobel Prize awards have been given to men. Through her significant efforts,
                            Wangari Maathai became the first African woman, and the first environmentalist, to win the Peace Prize.</p>
                     <p>In June 2009, Maathai was named as one of PeaceByPeace.com's first peace heroes. Until her death in 2011, Maathai served on the Eminent Advisory Board
                          of the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa (AWEPA).

                        Wangarĩ Maathai died on 25 September 2011 of complications arising from ovarian cancer while receiving treatment at a Nairobi hospital.
                        
                        She is buried at the Wangari Maathai Institute for Peace and Environmental Studies in Nairobi.</p>
